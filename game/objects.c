// NOTE: These are the objects which appear on the screen. Each object has it's own
// text. As the user types, the text must act accordingly. If the full word is typed
// the "object" is given to the player. So we need a spawner here, logic to read the
// inputs and logic to give the objects to the player.

// TODO: Render text
// TODO: Have good input reading
// TODO: Match the inputs to the object's text
// TODO: Logic to add objects to the player
